I used rust this time as a way to start to learn rust.

#### Disclaimer:

These implementations should not be considered for any production application.

They are:
- super hacky
- only reflect my ability to get a decent score on the aoc leaderboard
- are not likely to be in a working state
- not written in a rustacean way


#### Building and Running:

``` bash
cargo build
cargo run all
```
